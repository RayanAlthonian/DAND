## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the data in the dataset named "TMDB Movie Dataset" which contains information about 10,000 movies collected from the Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

**General Notes About the Dataset:**

* Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|)
characters.
* The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time

**Questions to be answered:**

* What are the most common genres ?  
* What is the average rating for each genre ? 
* Did movies with high vote count receive a better rating?
* How does the amount of movies change from year to year ?
